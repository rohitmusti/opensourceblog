                          <p>Intellectual Property, or IP, has been the industry standard solution for creating new and innovative technologies. The definition of intellectual property is: property (such as an idea, invention, or process) that derives from the work of the mind or intellect. Intellectual property rights are important as they allow an individual to lay claim to their intellectual property which can then be used to profit off their ideas. For centuries, intellectual property rights have been a corner stone of economic growth. Now, with the rise of Open Source Design, or OSD, this paradigm is being challenged for the first time in human history.</p> <br/>
                          <p>Patent law is the law surrounding how one can secure a patent. A patent is simply a government backed document that guarantees exclusive rights to intellectual property. In the United States, patents have been the norm when it comes to securing intellectual property rights. The process for acquiring patents is lengthy, complex, and tedious. It can take several years to secure the exclusive rights to an idea using the patent system of securing your intellectual property. In the modern world, with technology evolving at break neck speeds, patents simply cannot keep up with the constant innovation. Furthermore, patents require huge legal departments to file and maintain them. This is an astronomical cost that cannot be footed by small businesses and start-ups, which are often at the center of the most innovative ideas.</p> <br/>
                          <p>Traditional companies benefit from the IP system as it allows them to block out competitors for selling similar products. So, for example, if a toy company came up with an innovative toy material that was more durable and child-friendly than any other material and they were able to secure a patent for that material, they could legally exclude all other manufacturers from using this material for a period of time. This would allow them to price and sell their toys with this new material with the safety net of knowing that no other company could match their product.</p> <br/>
                          <p>Technological companies don't benefit from this IP system. Given the ubiquity of technology, the collaborative nature of computer science, and the speed at which these innovations are made, it is impractical to try to patent every single idea as often times there is no way to fully exclude others from it as there are millions of implementations to any solution. Often times, creators and developers will even benefit from others using their solution as they will receive quicker feedback, analytics, and people may even improve on their design for them. Clearly, the tradition patent/IP system is failing this particular market.</p>
                          <p>Open Source Design provides a revolutionary alternative to traditional IP protocols. Open Source Design involves making your design and thoughts (your secret sauce) available to the world at large. So instead of hiding away your revolutionary idea until you secure a patent for it, you make it open to the public for everyone to use. The benefits of this concept are boundless.</p> <br/>
                          <p>One such benefit is the ability to have others contribute to your idea. Often times, with open sourced computer science projects, developers will 'fork' them. This is a colloquial term for taking an existing project, copying it over exactly, and them building your own version on top of it. So, if someone build a very innovative algorithm for machine learning and open sources it, then people can use that algorithm, change a few parts, and develop the capability to apply it in a totally new context. </p> <br/>
                          <p>Open source designs also allow for innovative ways to gather data and get information on consumers. This is innovative because consumers don't have to pay for the product or service they are using and companies don't need to pay exorbitant amounts of money to pay for data on consumers. Facebook uses data from every website that uses their login. This provides them valuable information on what other products their customers use so they can target advertisements even more specifically. This is only possible given that they open source their login capabilities. Open source design allows for a completely new level of information on each individual consumer and businesses are quickly realizing all of the potential for this data.</p>
