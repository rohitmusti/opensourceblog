                          <p>In the past, information was not as ubiquitous as it is today. Information was concentrated at universities and scientific laboratories. Innovation required years of study to develop a sense of what was possible and to cross-apply knowledge between feels. Now, lectures from the top physicist in the world are a click away, literally at the fingertips of children. This could allow for unprecedented innovation; in some situations, it has done just that. However, the freedom of knowledge and education could vastly limit access and ability to act on the incredible available resources.</p> <br/>
                          <p>Governments have tried to control information and innovation through the censorship and intellectual property laws. I will focus on the latter for this blog post. An issue with our current patent system is that there is no way to diffuse innovation throughout the economy. With all of the uncertainty surrounding what a patent covers and when it can be invoked, most innovation gets bottle-necked at a few companies that control the patents. This is in direct contradiction to the intention of patents, to encourage innovation. [1]</p> <br/>
                          <p>A specific example of patents stifling innovation is the tech giants battling one another in the courtroom. Apple and Samsung spend billions of dollars thwarting one another's attempts to innovate on existing technology. Apple sued Samsung for applying existing technology, that Apple was the first to use widely, in a new way. Essentially, Apple has sued Samsung for innovation. Patents incentivize multi-million dollar lawsuits that suck resources and deter others from innovating. If patents continue to dominate America's tech industry, great ideas may never take off and innovation will certainly continue to stall. [2]</p> <br/>
                          <p> This system of acquiring patents and technology and spending billions of dollars suing your competitors for following your trend wastes huge amounts of resources. These tech companies are extremely judicious with how they appropriate their resources through their budget. Under the IP and patent system, they have to stifle the information and resources they've developed. This blocks them off from the innovation of their competitors and it causes huge costs. An open source system would democratize the information and largely remove most of these costs.</p><br/>
                          <p>Economist David Kline argues in favor of patents for a period of US history. The historical record of the US 19th century is indisputable: in that day and age, patents promoted innovation and growth. [3] But what about today? The global economic landscape has gone through multiple paradigm shifts since patents were proven effective; we should not use such an antiquated system moving forward.</p>
                          <p>Patents are also plainly ineffective. The most recent example of this was Instagram flat out stealing Instagram's story feature. This was a case where the technology was patented and it was simply used regardless of the existing patent to Instagram's advantage. Another example of this is Amazon's new video streaming service. Twitter holds patents over the technology used in Amazon's streaming service. Yet, Amazon has just buried them in litigation. Patents now benefit big corporations, not inventors. For any innovative app to even make it to market, it has to work with Apple and Google. This bottleneck allows them to discover what has and hasn't been patented and gives them the opportunity to pursue acquiring the patent and filing for a new one. [4]</p> <br/>
                          <p>Clearly the restriction of knowledge through patents is a failing system. This is most clear when one examines education. When one examines the most well put-together information available, it comes from open source lectures and materials put on the internet by the world's top instructors. This allows for sharing resources amongst schools, connecting individuals that are using the technology, and highlighting the most effective practices as they emerge. [5]</p>
