                          <p>The open source design movement has formed strong roots within the climate change community. Because traditional institutions, such as the government and big business, have failed the to address climate change, they have looked to more decentralized solutions to help preserve the planet. Open source design is the best way to quickly, and cheaply, spread an idea. It also allows for strong customization for different environments and need. Furthermore, open source works most ideally in a collaborative environment; the fight against climate change has formed an extremely strong community that constantly collaborates. </p> <br/>
                          <p>In a reaction to the failure of COP21, the twenty-first attempt of world leaders to combat climate change, the open source community collaborated to create POC21. POC21 is an international innovation network that has produced a number of incredible, ingenious open source solutions to climate change problems. Their most notable projects include the $30 wind turbine [3] (discussed by the “Social Impact of Energy” group in their group presentation), self-filtering showers, and low-waste urban farms. This conference, and many of the associated products, demonstrate the influence, size, and power of the open source climate change community. [2]</p> <br />

                            <p>One benefit that open source provides for the climate change community is that it allows for the most eyes possible to be on a problem. By having the problem, solutions, and past experiments completely available to the public, open source provides an ideal platform to keep up with the pace of research, dissemination of solutions, and scrutiny of governments. This results in, literally, the entire world solving the problems with one another to reach the most informed and optimal solution. [1]</p> <br />
                            <p>Another interesting corollary of open source is that it limits waste. By making all past and current experiments open, it ensures that no two teams waste time on the same angle. This happens to be an extremely efficient and sustainable model of improvement. [1]</p> <br />
                            <p>One of the challenges faced is generating enough investment to get many of these open source labs off the ground. It is difficult to demonstrate the value in a product/company beyond the IP. Therefore, the lack of investment is a throttling the growth. However, the investors are beginning to understand new valuation models and are beginning to invest in some of the open source designs. [1] </p> <br />
                            <p>One example of an open source solution for tackling sustainable, urban food growth is “GrowGrid”. These are literally raised wood beds for space efficient urban farming. These boxes can even be stacked on top of one another in a “GrowWall” set up. For urban composting, there is an open source composting apparatus called the “WormHaus” that literally turns food scraps into natural fertilizer. In an effort to combat the bee crisis, the “Colorado Top Bar” is an at home bee farm. [4]</p> <br />
                            <p>Another example of an extremely successful open source design project is the “$30 Wind Farm”. It can be assembled in 4-6 hours by 2 people. This cheap wind farm was designed in part of an effort to make the sustainable energy more accessible to low-income and under-served population. This is essential to help renewable energy solutions move from the market of toys of the rich to tools for everyone. [3]</p> <br />
