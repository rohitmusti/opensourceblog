                          <p>	This semester has been an interesting journey in exploring the merits of open source design. I have been forced to challenge my notion of what it means to control intellectual property and the balance of social and financial benefits. Marrying social goals with financial goals has spawned an incredible field of social entrepreneurship and open source design is a growing fad in this space.</p><br />
                          <p>	Entering this class, I had a limited view of open source design. I thought that it was an extension of the “freemium” profit model – in which companies make some of their product free, in an effort to convince users to purchase licenses to their proprietary technology. This failed to capture many of the incredible attributes of the open source ethos.</p><br />

                            <p>	Out of all the benefits to open source design, the most ‘romantic’ notion is the idea of collaboration. There is a notion that open source technology creates communities. The hope is that people will modify technology for their purposes and publish their improvements so that they can be used by others. This is an extremely optimistic notion that has actually succeeded in many instances. On GitHub, a platform for developers to share their code with one another, there are many projects with thousands of favorites and modifications, all free for anyone to download to use. These projects from hard core backend server code to ‘the bread code’, a repository full of instructions on the best ways to make bread. [1] </p><br />
                            <p>	Something that excites businesses about open source is the prospect of unlimited innovation and an endless supply of developers. When companies open source their software, they’re intentions are to reduce legal costs and increase R&D productivity. If an idea is built on opensource, then it cannot be subsequently moved to private intellectual property. Thus, if a company like Tesla open sources some of their battery management software, and Nissan uses that software in their cars and contributes some sort of improvement to the software, Nissan is supposed to these improvements with Tesla and the global community. Therefore, battery management software can advance much faster and every car would have the latest and greatest versions. This is hugely powerful for jumpstarting the rate of innovation for the latest technologies where the relevant experts are scattered across companies and have few tools for working together. Tesla has adopted this strategy by open sourcing all of their technology, as we discussed in class. This is part of an effort to bring open source design into the mainstream business culture.

                            <p>	One of the more interesting benefits of open source design is the legal aspects of owning ideas and property. Open source forces businesses to derive their value not from the patent of the technology per se, but from their business model and delivery of the design. This de-centralizes a lot of business power and there are few industries where this is simple to implement. The legal portion of this is what constitutes property of a company and what it means to profit of an open source software platform.</p><br />
                            <p>	I feel invigorated when considering all the opportunities presented by open source design. The potential for collaboration and new opportunities is limitless and I am excited to explore open source this summer through working at Red Hat, a leader in open source technology.</p><br />
