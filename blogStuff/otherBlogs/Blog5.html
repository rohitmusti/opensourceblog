                          <p>The most prominent open source food solution is the Open Food Network. This organization is a "holarchy".  A holarchy is essentially a self-regulating group of nodes. What this means in the context of open source food is that each individual node or smaller food network is self-sustaining and easily integrates into the larger network. The Open Food Network functions with three branches of each node: Food Producers, Food Hubs, and Food System Partners. Food producers are those who farm, pickle, and bring the food to the FoodHubs. The Food Hubs are those that buy food in bulk from the farmers to be sold on the Open Food Network. Food system partners are places that sell the food. [1]</p> <br/>
                          <p>The open source aspect of the Open Food Network is that any person can plug into any aspect of their network through their open source model. By open sourcing their business model and platform, the network creates opportunity for any participants to join while lowering the overhead costs. This type of model, open source food networks, is growing in popularity. It is part of a trend towards farm-to-table efforts. These open source models allow for local purchasing which drives circular economies; they allow for lowered distribution costs; and they allow for perfect information exchanges between farmers and their markets. These synergies add up to produce a more robust and self-reliant micro-economy within each node of open source distribution networks. [2]</p><br/>
                          <p> Intellectual property, through patents, has entered the food space. Many companies are patenting specifically modified plant genomes that have unique properties. These properties include growing in hazardous conditions, with less resources, and producing. more or different nutrients. [3] In order to help companies recover the costs of investing so many resources into producing these special seeds, they use patents to protect their investment. While these patents don't allow for other researchers to continue investigating that specific genome, there is no other solution to guarantee that the cost of producing the genome can be recovered. Otherwise, there would be no method of preventing these companies from going bankrupt as producers simply steal their special genomes.</p> <br/>
                          <p>Walmart is also investing in a new type of patent in the food space. Blockchain technologies, as discussed and defined in previous blogs, hold incredible potential to create efficiencies in business systems. Walmart has invented a special blockchain solution that allows customers to identify themselves more easily on deliveries and track their food at every point on their route. Their claim is that it will allow for more accountability and safety in the transportation process. They have plans to incorporate drones into their solution to increase both speed of delivery and trust in the process. [4]</p><br/>
                          <p>Another application of IP in the food problem space is 3D printing. 3D printing, when combined with AI and biological materials, can literally print foods. If this technology can be made cheaply, there is great potential to deploy these into low-income areas or areas hit by natural disasters so those without resources can print their food using whatever biomass is available around them. It is difficult to incentivize corporations to develop these technologies without the promise of a patent to recuperate costs. [5]</p> <br/>
