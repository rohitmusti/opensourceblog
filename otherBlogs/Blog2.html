                          <p>Inequality is the primary driver of the United States economy. The different abilities of individuals allow them to contribute value to one another's lives, thus creating value. Throughout much of the United States history, we were not a knowledge-based economy. Therefore, the fact that some information was restricted did not significantly contribute to inequality as much as rigid social structures. In the 21st century, the United States has shifted towards a knowledge-based economy. Now, information is what is valued and sought after by Western Society. Given this new paradigm, patents and the IP system are throttling the opportunity for others to improve their socio-economic status.</p> <br/>
                          <p>The benefits of the IP system with our knowledge-based economy is that it allows those with patents to achieve wealth like never before. However, these are clearly outweighed by the costs of limiting social mobility.</p> <br/>
                          <p>Open Source offers a compelling alternative to the outdated patent system. This new system would leave information unrestricted and allow the application of the information to be the primary driver of the world, still allowing for individuals to shine and rise. The democratization of information would clearly result in an inherently more balanced system which allows more growth to occur without penalizing those who worked for the knowledge. For example, Tesla does not file patents for much of their developments and they are still a thriving company. This case study displays the power of an open source solution.</p> <br/>
                          <p>An objection to Open Source would be that the system doesn't incentivize people to create new innovations and inventions because they don't have as much incentive to put in all of the effort required. While this objection has some merit, it falls short when faced with examples like Tesla and several other thriving open source companies and products.</p> <br/>
