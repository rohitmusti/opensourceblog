                          <p>There has been a revolution in the healthcare industry. In the past, IT health tools have been primarily implemented with the intent of making the administration and mechanics of managing healthcare and smooth and simple as possible. In the past few years and moving forward, healthcare IT is focused on improving the quality of healthcare. The recent development of Internet of Things devices, big data, and artificial intelligence have taken root in the healthcare industry. Many of these new technologies that are providing healthcare for millions, rely on open source software. Champions of open source rejoice and point to this as a success instance of open source technology, while watchdogs remain weary, waiting for a mistake to occur on a bad merge.
                          </p> <br />
                          <p>As with all open source software, one of the benefits of open source healthcare software is the continuous improvements made to the software. Have thousands of eyes on each line of code ensure that every single line is as efficient as possible and functioning as it ought to.</p>

                            <p>One benefit of open source software distinct to the healthcare system is the seamless integration of many systems. Each individual healthcare provider has their own mechanisms of reporting, and the modular nature of open source software allows it to plug into almost any of the systems without a hitch. This modularity allows for an unprecedented level of flexibility and proliferation of the software.</p><br />
                            <p>Another corollary of this benefit is the challenge of the inter-connected nature of Internet of Things devices. Because of the widespread use of fitness trackers and healthcare trackers available to consumers, building an individual system to understand the data of each one would be both inefficient, and it wouldn’t be future proof. With open source technology, it is designed to be “plug and play”; users can just securely send their fitness data to their doctors who can review the data and get a more accurate sense of a patient’s lifestyle. [1] This is a huge benefit to doctors, allowing them to rely on objective data and not patient’s inaccurate responses. Furthermore, any typical tests, such as heart rate, that are usually affected by the anxiety of physically being inside of a doctor’s office, by using Fitbits and smart watch trackers, doctors are able to get a less biased read on their patient’s heart health and general diagnostics.</p><br />
                            <p>The healthcare industry is full of rigorous standards that devices and practices must comply with. By building an open source software, it can be easily updated and modified by any user to comply with any specific regulations. Moreover, different versions of the same system can be built to follow different standards in different countries. Information security is an example of an extremely important concern in their healthcare IT industry. Since open source software is subject to constant developer scrutiny (it is not shipped and then forgotten about), most security flaws are discovered and corrected for very quickly. [2]</p><br />
                            <p>Overall, there is a lot of room for the flexibility, adaptability, and security of open source software to be used for the bettering of the healthcare industry.</p><br />
                            <p>One negative of open source software is the legal liability. Because it is so difficulty to trace a feature not working back to one specific administrator or developer, any hospital system that uses open source software has no recourse if the system fails. While this may not be a common occurrence, this makes the hospital take on a much larger amount of liability. [3] This makes lawsuits involving open source software extremely complicated. While there are laws in place to address this problem, there is no clear solution and varies on a case by case basis and this must be made more clear for widespread use to continue to grow. </p><br />
