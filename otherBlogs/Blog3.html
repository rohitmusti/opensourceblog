                          <p>IP energy solutions have dominated the energy market for the last 150 years. Now open source energy exchanges and energy production techniques are edging their way into the market and may dominate the future of how energy is bought, sold, and produced.</p> <br/>
                          <p>One of the most powerful examples of open source energy done right is Grid+. Grid+ is a peer-to-peer energy solution built on the blockchain. The way it works is their device, when connected to your home grid, automates paying for electricity bills and the buying and selling of electricity over the grid in deregulated energy markets in the United States. Their software is used, most notably in the Brooklyn Microgrid, by independent home owners who produce their own power with renewables. Before, there was no easy way to sell energy back to the grid and no way to force energy companies to price more competitively. Now, with Grid+, residents in neighborhoods where Grid+ is active, users can not only sell energy back to the grid, but also buy energy from their peers, bypassing all other intermediaries. This is an incredible project and its software, and blockchain it is based on, is completely open sourced. [1][2]</p> <br/>
                          <p>Another powerful example of an open source energy solution is W.E. Power. W.E. Power is a blockchain based green energy platform. Their goal is to enable green energy producers to raise capital through offering energy tokens that have an inherit value that is energy. Their token and open source security models hold promise of decentralizing energy production and dropping prices for all parties involved while increasing revenues by cutting out distributors and middle-men. [3]</p> <br/>
                          <p>Tesla is the most built out open-source company in production. They have open sourced and released all of their patents. Their goal is to get their technology into as many hands in possible. This has several possible benefits. One benefit could potentially be to increase incentives for existing companies and governments to build out energy charging infrastructure. Another benefit would be using the research done by others based on the initial release of the patents would be available for Tesla to use. It also cuts down on the typical legal fees associated with filing for and protecting patents. [4]</p> <br/>

                          <p>One drawback of open source design solutions is that they don't allow for protections against larger companies and competitors. That is to say that without patents, it can be difficult for small businesses that stumble upon innovative ideas to gain a competitive advantage. This is a particularly powerful deterrent in the energy market-space which is naturally lent towards monopolies by the nature of grid-maintenance being outsourced to private companies in most countries. Challenging these major companies requires smaller start-ups to have their ideas protected so that they cannot be unfairly exploited and undercut by competition. Monopolies often stifle innovation as they have no need innovate beyond keeping the government regulators, that legally protect their monopoly.</p> <br/>
                          <p>Intellectual property rights also encourage investment. While there are certainly investment incentives under an open source model, most innovative technologies require patent protection for investors to reduce the risk of their investment and increase the capital injection. This increased capital injection allows for faster and more stable growth, increasing the likelihood of success. It is difficult to reproduce this investment security under an open source model. </p> <br/>
                          <p>An interest concept in green energy initiatives is windmill farms. Most companies buy their energy from the grid at standard pricing. If companies adopt the open source windmill technology, then they have the potential to save millions of dollars in energy costs. This is an example of incorporating open source hardware and software into an existing business model to create long term savings and reduced overhead in the years to come. [5] </p>
