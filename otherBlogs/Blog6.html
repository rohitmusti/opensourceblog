                            <p>Internet of Things (i.e. IOT) devices are the billions of devices that are now connected to the internet. These are not just limited to smart-phones; now, lightbulbs, thermostats, even children's toy trucks are connected to the internet. [1] Among the many implications of this proliferation of technology, there is now an unprecedented amount of communication between these amongst these devices. Living in a more connected world, allows for great strides to made in sustainability movements, such as the nest thermostat greatly reducing the impact of households. Along with all of these benefits, there are growing concerns of privacy and implications of all of this data made available by IOT devices.</p><br>

                            <p>There are many benefits to using open source platform on IOT devices. One of the advantages is customization. Oftentimes, devices need customized channels of communications. By the very nature of open source collaboration, there is an unlimited level of customization available for each user. Since the codebases of open source solutions are very malleable, there is a high level of customization that users can build into the system.</p> <br/>
                            <p>Another advantage is seamless integration. By using an open source platform, any other device on that platform will be able to easily interface with any other device on the platform. This allows for synergies and a more complete integration of smart devices with one another, creating a smart home. An example of how this may be useful is having a smart fridge interface with an Alexa to seamlessly order food as supplies run low in the fridge.</p><br/>
                            <p>Another advantage of open source systems is the support that is easily available. Online communities develop around open source technologies to share new solutions and different forks of the platform. This allows for peer-to-peer support for every aspect of the software and a forum to trouble-shoot common problems. [2]</p><br/>
                            <br>
                            <p>There are also some drawbacks to using open source platforms for IOT devices. One of the costs is very having to do the work of integrating platform into the existing product. With IP solutions, the engineers who design the platform are often the ones who integrate it to products. This allows for a higher-degree of specialization and reduces the time cost of integrating the device into the platform. Another cost is the lack of privacy of data. While users can create their own security protocols, those protocols will inherently also be open source. Therefore, the any security benefit is off set by the public nature of the security. This lack of privacy is a drawback to using open source platforms as, most of the time, IOT devices track data that users would desire to be private. Another drawback of open source platforms is the sheer amount of data. Since the platform is open, there is no centralized identity that manages the generated data. The negative implication of this is that users have to manage their own data when incorporating an open source platform. This adds a massive overhead cost to any operation. Furthermore, it also places the onus of data analytics onto the users of open source platforms. Given the challenges of managing and incorporating this data, many turn towards traditional IP platforms for open source solutions. [3] </p> <br/>
                            <p>There are also three broad benefits of open source solutions. One benefit is increased profits. Because the low cash costs of open source solutions, they don't have any of the huge costs associated with IP solutions. Another benefit is increased opportunities for revenue generation. Using open source platforms, companies have more options to sell or analyze the data of their users to identify new opportunities and threat. One long term decision is the benefits of being able to have access to the raw data associated with Open Source platforms and benefit from the mistakes and successes of others in the market place.
