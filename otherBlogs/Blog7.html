                            <p>Open source infrastructure primarily exists in the digital space. The biggest hub of open source digital tools on the internet is GitHub. GitHub is essentially a platform that allows coders to share code and collaborate on projects easily. Furthermore, they are starting to build in a live-typing feature to allow real time collaboration on the same file, similar to what google drive allows for in documents. One of the key features of GitHub is that all the code is inherently open source (with paid options to privatize the projects). This allows for unprecedented collaboration, any person can download the source code of massively powerful digital tools and infrastructures, such as NodeJs. NodeJs has fundamentally transformed the way we interact with JavaScript and create new applications.</p> <br/>

                            <p>This open sourced digital infrastructure has allowed for near constant innovation. Because almost every computer programmer in the world uses GitHub to share and update code, everyone benefits from the progress of the entire coding community. Independent discoveries of the same idea developing in parallel has been replaced by previously distinct teams coming together to collaborate on the project together. Furthermore, as alluded to above, a strong sense of collaboration has developed amongst the computer science community and code meet ups are now commonplace.</p> <br/>
                            <p>Another benefit to open source infrastructure is the transparency of the code base. Most traditional projects only allow team members to have access to specific parts of the code. This often prevents a full understanding of the project and efficient collaboration. Full transparency allows for all users to feel more comfortable interacting with the code so they are not locked in to any software or giving their information to any person or organization they feel uncomfortable with.</p><br/>
                            <p>Open source projects also tend to be more reliable than traditional IP projects as well. This is because open source projects have many more programmers contributing to the code. This constant tinkering and diverse perspectives produces more robust, cleaner code. This superior code is often optimized to be the best possible version of a product, not the most profitable and without deadlines. Proprietary infrastructure often locks users and developers into one infrastructure with little flexibility. Open source code has build in flexibility and modularity, allowing for programmers to “hack” together solutions from a series of different sources. [1]</p><br/>
                            <p>To return to the earlier point about the culture around open source, creating and maintaining open source infrastructure is often compared to non-profit work. Part-time contributions are similar to offer volunteering hours for an organization where as full-time maintenance and creation is like working at a non-profit. [2] </p> <br/>
                            <p>Security infrastructure has traditionally been developed in secret. Developers refusing to share their builds, lest a malicious actor grabs hold of the “blueprints”. This paradigm of secret digital security infrastructure has been flipped on its head by open source development. By sharing the most advanced security protocols available between organizations, any hole in the software is discovered and fixed. Furthermore, after attacks, organizations and individuals are able to share security information about their builds. [3]</p><br/>
